What should I start reading?
========
## Purpose
One lazy afternoon, I was in the mood to start a new book. As I looked at my bookshelves, I quickly became overwhelmed with the options. I just wanted someone to pick a book for me.

This application is my solution. It is meant to return a book title from the books within my personal library.

## Design
### First Iteration
The first iteration simply returns a random book title from inputed array. This array is a small list of my book titles.
### Later Design
Utilize google books api to pull random book from a specific bookshelf under my google books acount. This now gives me access to parse books based on genre. Instead of returning just a title, I should be able to return a book cover that can then display the other book information.
